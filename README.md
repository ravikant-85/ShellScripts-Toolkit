# Description
Welcome to the DevOps Shell Script Toolkit repository! Here, you'll find a collection of shell scripts for various DevOps tools including Docker, Terraform, AWS CLI, Trivy, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. These scripts are designed to simplify and automate common tasks, allowing you to focus more on building and deploying your applications rather than managing infrastructure.

## Features -

- **One-Click Automation**: Just wanted to save your time and be fast! Each script is crafted to be easily executable with a single click, saving you valuable time and effort.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Scripts are tested and compatible with both Ubuntu and Amazon Linux distributions, ensuring flexibility in your deployment environments.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From containerization with Docker to infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, and managing Kubernetes clusters, we've got you covered with scripts for various DevOps tasks.
- **Easy to Use**: Whether you're a seasoned DevOps engineer or just getting started, scripts are designed to be intuitive and straightforward to use.

-  - lauch Sonarqube using this -
     
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
    ```


## Usage -

  - If you want to create something, make a file with a .sh extension. For example, if you intend to use Jenkins, create a file named `` vim jenkins.sh``.
  - Next, copy the entire .sh code from the above file and paste it into the ```jenkins.sh``` file.
  - Then execute the script using this command: ```chmod +x ./jenkins.sh```.
  - The final and last step is to run the script command this: ```./jenkins.sh```.
  - Congratulations! Check your IP with port :8080. It will open Jenkins, and then enjoy.

  - **Repeat the process for any additional scripts or tasks you wish to execute.**
